--------------------------
- Review this file and confirm the exact new app name and logo files to apply.
- Decide whether to keep git history. If you want a clean history, remove .git and re-init after applying rebrand.
- Prepare new icons in `icons/production` and `icons/development` and provide them to the repo before applying.
- When ready to apply replacements, run the script with `--apply "NewName"` (not implemented by default in dry-run mode).
